# Locker
### anti-troll utility ;)

Skip typing long password, just press one key to lock/unlock your computer.
When Locker is in <i>locked</i> mode, no password is needed, but if someone touches anything(mouse, keyboard) else than you secret key, PC gets locked => [win] + [L].
Additionally Locker can log when USB device is inserted.

<b>PS: This is not secure solution if you need really protect your data. This is more like, protect PC before your colleagues.

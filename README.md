# Locker

You can skip typing long password, just press one key to lock and unlock your computer.
If the app is in locked mode and someone touches anything it will use the classic windows lock.
This app doesn't focus on high safety, but on comfortable locking the PC. 


...and you can fool some colleagues which think the PC is unlocked :)
